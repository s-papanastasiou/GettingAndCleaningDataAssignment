# GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment

This repo contains the coursework for week 4 for the GettingAndCleaningData course.

The following files are included:

CodeBook.md -- contains information on what transformation were done to the original dataset in order to clean it up and make it usable for import in R.

README.md -- this file.

run_analysis.R -- running this R script in the Samsung dataset directory (i.e. in the UCI HAR Dataset directory) will produce a tidy data set csv file called summaryData.csv. The file is heavily commented so feel free to read through to see how it works

summaryData.csv -- this is the product of running run_analysis.R in the Samsung dataset directory.
